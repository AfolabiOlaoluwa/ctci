# Answers/Notes to [Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Ed.](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com)

To join our [Slack CTCI study group](https://linkedin-jr-engineers.slack.com), send me your email.

Gayle McDowell's [crowdsourced CTCI solutions](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition), by programming language.

I've organized a group to code through all 189 coding interview questions in Gayle McDowell's book "Cracking the Coding Interview" together. I'll do them in Java, but use any language you wish.

We're meeting **every Saturday 11 am PST, on Google Hangouts! Post your Gmail address on [our Slack thread](https://linkedin-jr-engineers.slack.com/archives/CDDPLUHQC/p1562782503045300) for the meeting, so I know whom to add**.

Most software engineers study this book to interview at FAANG companies: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google, Microsoft, etc.

I made 9 Slack channels for us. Please join them:

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java) is my code editor. I installed its [Java Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack).

I cloned [Gayle's GitHub solutions](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition) and opened the /Java folder in VS Code. It instantly told me what to install and let me start running/debugging code with breakpoints, with NO configuration! Super easy.
