# Answers/Notes to [Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Ed.](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com)

Our [Slack CTCI study group](https://linkedin-jr-engineers.slack.com). To join, send me your email.

Gayle McDowell's [crowdsourced CTCI solutions](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition), by programming language.

I've organized a group to code through all 189 coding interview questions in Gayle McDowell's book "Cracking the Coding Interview" together. I'll do them in Java, but please use any language you wish. We can meet in person (in LA) or online on weekends, to keep us motivated and disciplined.

This book is what most software engineers study to prepare to interview at FAANG companies: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google, etc.

I made 5 channels for us. Please join them in Slack:

- [#ctci-big-o](https://linkedin-jr-engineers.slack.com/messages/CKTPDEEN6/) (Big O Time/Space Complexity). Chapter VI.
- [#ctci-ch01](https://linkedin-jr-engineers.slack.com/messages/CL7AFTC6A/) (Arrays and Strings)
- [#ctci-ch02](https://linkedin-jr-engineers.slack.com/messages/CL930575L/) (Linked Lists)
- [#ctci-ch03](https://linkedin-jr-engineers.slack.com/messages/CL930EVPY/) (Stacks and Queues)
- [#ctci-ch04](https://linkedin-jr-engineers.slack.com/messages/CL0HVSS49/) (Trees and Graphs)

VS Code is my code editor: https://lnkd.in/giVaGaT. I installed their Java Extension Pack: https://lnkd.in/g-qDisW.

I cloned Gayle's GitHub solutions and opened the /Java folder in VS Code. It instantly told me what to install and let me start running/debugging code with breakpoints, with NO configuration! Super easy.

Also:

- I made a [#pair-programming](https://linkedin-jr-engineers.slack.com/messages/CL6UDFVSR/) channel for anyone to ask for help or offer to work together on code with others.
- Please [#introduce-yourself](https://linkedin-jr-engineers.slack.com/messages/CDG6ZSWMU/) and talk about your [#job-search](https://linkedin-jr-engineers.slack.com/messages/CDE3RK8QY/).
- Our [#eloquentjavascript](https://linkedin-jr-engineers.slack.com/messages/CDD6ZFLTS/) channel discusses that book.
