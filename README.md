Gayle McDowell's [crowdsourced CTCI solutions](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition), by programming language.

This group will code through all 189 coding interview questions in Gayle McDowell's book "Cracking the Coding Interview" together. I'll do them in Java, but use any language you wish.

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java) is my code editor. I installed its [Java Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack).

I cloned [Gayle's GitHub solutions](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition) and opened the /Java folder in VS Code. It instantly told me what to install and let me start running/debugging code with breakpoints, with NO configuration! Super easy.
